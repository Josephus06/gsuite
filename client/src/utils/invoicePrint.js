// How the items are packed into the band, and where each one sits.
//
// THE BAND IS A FIXED HEIGHT AND THE SPACING INSIDE IT ADJUSTS. The pre-printed form gives the
// items a fixed area -- rowsPerPage rules, rowHeight apart, so 6 x 5mm = 30mm below items.top.
// Packing one item per rule capped a sheet at six items and sent a seventh onto a second
// pre-printed form, which costs a BIR serial for what is really a spacing decision.
//
// So the unit of packing is the TEXT LINE, not the rule, and the vertical pitch between lines is
// whatever divides the band evenly for the content on it -- never tighter than the text itself
// (line height at the base font) and never looser than the form's own rule spacing:
//
//   pitch = clamp(bandHeight / linesOnThisPage, lineHeight, rowHeight)
//
// A sparse sheet therefore looks exactly as it did -- one or two items land on the printed rules,
// because the clamp holds pitch at rowHeight. A full one closes up until the band is used. At 6pt
// the text line is 2.44mm, so a 30mm band holds 12 lines: ten single-line items sit at a 3mm
// pitch with room to spare, and only a genuinely longer invoice starts a second form.

// looks squashed.
