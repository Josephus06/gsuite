// Shared "released commission" allocation for the Commission report and Commission Payable.
//
// A Commission Voucher releases commission against one or more monthly payables (its lines carry a
// gross released amount each) and may add expense adjustments. Per the business rule:
//   - a DEDUCTION (negative expense) waterfalls from the EARLIEST month, reducing that month's net
//     released until the deduction is used up, then spilling into the next month, and so on;
//   - a REFUND (positive expense) is added to the earliest month;
//   - the NET released for a month = gross − deducted + refunded, and the voucher's total net
//     released equals its Total Payments ("the total voucher created").
// e.g. Jan 1000 / Feb 215 with a −1115 deduction => Jan 0 (deducted 1000), Feb 100 (deducted 115).
