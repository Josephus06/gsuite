// Allocating the next document number for a table whose number column is UNIQUE.
//
// WHY THIS IS NOT JUST `PO-${insertId}`. Documents were imported from the live system carrying
// THEIR ORIGINAL NUMBERS while their ids were reassigned, so a number and the id of the row
// holding it have nothing to do with each other: PO-19571 belongs to row 438. Deriving the number
// from the auto-increment works right up until that counter climbs into the range the imported
// numbers occupy, and then every create is a coin toss -- "Duplicate entry 'PO-19571' for key
// 'purchase_orders.po_no'" is that coin landing badly. Measured on purchase_orders: 19,470 of
// 19,475 rows carry a number that is not their own id, and 498 of those sit at or above the next
// id, so they were 498 failures waiting to happen.
//
// Transfer orders, fulfilments and receipts hit this first and were fixed in place; this is that
// fix lifted out so the next table does not have to rediscover it.
const pool = require('../db');

// Read on the POOL, not on the caller's connection, and deliberately so.
//
// The caller is inside a transaction, and InnoDB's default REPEATABLE READ pins that transaction
// to the snapshot of its first read. So when two creates race, the loser's retry re-reads its own
// stale snapshot, cannot see the row the winner just committed, computes the same number again,
// and fails on every attempt. A separate autocommit connection sees the current committed state,
// which is what "the next free number" has to mean.
// ...AND ALSO ON THE CALLER'S CONNECTION, taking whichever is higher.
//
// The pool alone is not enough, and the case it misses is not exotic: one request that creates
// SEVERAL numbered documents in one transaction. A Purchase Order request splits its lines by
// supplier and inserts one PO per group, all before committing. The pool cannot see rows this
// transaction has not committed, so the second PO computed the SAME number as the first and
// collided with its own sibling -- immediately, not by blocking, because they share a
// transaction. Every retry recomputed the same number from the same pool, so all five failed and
// the whole request rolled back. Measured on the droplet: five attempts, all 'PO-20088', and no
// PO-20088 in the table afterwards because the rollback took the first one with it.
//
// So: the pool answers "what has everyone else committed", the caller's connection answers "what
// have I taken already", and the next number has to clear both.
//
// TWO BOXES, ONE NUMBER SPACE (2026-10-03). The droplet and the office box replicate both ways and
// both take new documents, so "highest + 1" on each could hand out the same number twice -- and a
// duplicate on a UNIQUE column stops replication dead (CPAY-37 and PO-20644 did, 2026-10-02/03).
// So the two boxes split the numbers: the droplet issues only ODD numbers, the office box only
// EVEN ones -- the same idea as their auto-increment offsets. Both count every number when finding
// the highest, so each box's next number still follows the latest document wherever it was made;
// the cost is that a box skips the other's numbers (CPAY-61, 63, 65 on the droplet).
//
// (For an hour on 2026-10-03 the office box suffixed -O instead; those numbers are still counted.)
//
// THREE BOXES (2026-10-07, the SM branch server). Odd/even only splits two ways, so the rule is now
// general: N boxes share the number space and each owns the numbers where number % N equals its
// auto-increment offset % N -- the droplet (offset 1), the office (2) and SM (3). With N = 2 that is
// exactly odd/even, so this changed nothing until N was raised.
//
// N is NOT per-box configuration. It lives in app_settings ('doc_no_slots', db/create-app-settings.js),
// which replicates, and is read on every number: raising it is one UPDATE on the droplet that reaches
// every box at once. Were each box told separately, a box still splitting two ways beside one splitting
// three ways would hand out the same number (4 is even AND 4 % 3 = 1), and a duplicate on a UNIQUE
// column stops replication.
