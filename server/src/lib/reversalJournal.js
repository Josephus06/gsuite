// The journal that reverses a voided document.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. This build derives the general ledger rather than posting it: lib/glImpact.js
// walks the documents and computes each one's entry on the fly. Voiding used to be modelled by
// dropping the document out of that walk -- a cancelled invoice, a void ticket, a void cheque
// simply stopped being visited -- which reverses the ledger by ERASING the original entry from
// the month it was in. A closed period quietly changed its mind about what happened in it, and
// there was nothing on the ledger to say a document had ever been written or withdrawn.
//
// A general ledger does not work that way, and neither did the system this one replaces: there,
// the original entry stands and a REVERSAL journal in the period of the void cancels it out. The
// 728 imported cheque journals are exactly that, and this reproduces them -- same status, same
// source_type/source_id link, the same "Voided from CHK-13640" line memo.
//
// So voiding now posts a mirror image of whatever the document's own GL Impact was, and
// lib/glImpact.js keeps visiting the voided document. The two net to zero across all time, the
// audit trail survives, and no past period is rewritten.
//
// READ WITH lib/glImpact.js. The two are one mechanism: if a document type is made to post a
// reversal here it MUST stop being excluded there, and the other way round. Doing one without the
// other is the double count that this feature was built to fix -- 676 cheque reversals were
// posting against cheques already excluded, 52.5M of ledger that reversed nothing.

// dated somewhere, and for those the document's own date is the only honest answer: it puts the
// reversal in the same period as the entry it cancels, so a historical void nets to zero inside
// its own month exactly as it does today. A void happening NOW passes the real date and lands in
