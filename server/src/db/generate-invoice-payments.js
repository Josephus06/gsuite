// One-off: reconstructs a Customer Payment for each imported invoice that has been (part-)
// paid, so paid invoices show their payment in Related Records and the Customer Payments
// module has data.
//
// WHY reconstructed rather than pulled from live: the live API exposes get_customer_payments
// (a list of payment headers) but NO payment->invoice detail endpoint, so which invoices a
// live PAY-#### settled isn't retrievable. Each imported invoice already carries its paid
// amount (gross_amount - amount_due), so this creates one payment per paid invoice for that
// exact amount. Amounts are accurate; the grouping (one payment per invoice) and the
// payment numbers (CPAY-<invoice_no>) are synthetic, not the live PAY-#### records.
//
// Scoped to the 4 migrated reps' 2026 invoices. The invoice's amount_due is left untouched
// (already correct) -- this only records the settlement. Idempotent: re-running replaces
// the payment matched by its synthetic number.
//
// --missing-only ADDED 2026-09-22, and it is the flag to use on a database that has already
// been through this script once. Without it, a whole-company run DELETES and re-creates the
// CPAY payment for all 71,786 paid invoices to fill the ~1,100 that have none -- 70,000-odd
// pointless writes, and on the droplet/office replication pair every one of them crosses the
// link. With it, the run is restricted to invoices that no customer payment line settles at
// all, which is the gap and nothing else.
//
// IT ALSO NETS OFF CREDIT MEMOS, which the unfiltered run never had to think about: 200 of the
// 1,193 invoices in that gap carry a credit memo application. Those amounts were settled by
// CREDIT, not by cash, and recording a cash receipt for them books money the company never
// received. So the amount written is (gross - amount due) - credits already applied; an invoice
// whose credits cover it is skipped outright (9 locally), and one they cover part of gets the
// remainder (191 locally, PHP 577,546.05 of credit netted out).
//
// The netting applies in every mode, not just this one -- it is simply the right amount. It
// changes nothing about the 70,666 payments an earlier full run already wrote unless someone
// re-runs that path, in which case they are rewritten a little smaller and more correctly.
