// outstanding. AR Aging answers a deliberately different question (it rebuilds balances from
// documents and so also counts 1,363 invoices marked paid with nothing recorded behind them);
// putting those on a collection worklist would have Treasury chasing invoices their own screen
// calls Paid In Full. See lib/arAging.js for why that report is right to differ.

// OR number, because no receipt was ever issued.

// what exposed this: money shown as collected on a day nobody collected it.
