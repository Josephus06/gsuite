// "We have made this before."
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// A third of everything this company prints it has printed before -- 6,981 descriptions
// repeat, across 40,845 job orders -- and until now the only way to find the last one was to
// remember it. This answers the question the rep actually has at the moment of quoting: what
// did we charge for this, and what did we make on it.
//
// TWO THINGS THE DATA FORCED, both found by running the numbers before writing the query:
//
// 1. THE MEAN IS A LIE HERE. For POSTER at qty 1 PC/S -- 3,845 lines -- the mean price is
//    208.68 and the MEDIAN is 100.00, because one line at 18,342.86 drags it. A rep shown the
//    mean would quote at double. So every figure below is a median with a p25-p75 band around
//    it, and the band is the point: it says "this normally goes for between X and Y", which is
//    an honest answer, where a single number pretending to be The Price is not.
//
// 2. GP IS MOSTLY ABSENT. Only 16,620 of 126,539 priced lines (13%) carry a non-zero gp_rate;
//    the rest were migrated without it. Averaging over the zeros produced "1.3% GP on POSTER",
//    which is nonsense that would have looked authoritative on screen. GP is therefore computed
//    ONLY over rows that have one, and the response says how many rows that was so the caller
//    can show "based on 136 jobs" or suppress it entirely.
//
// SCOPING: the matched ROWS follow the sales-rep visibility rule like every other list in this
// app -- a rep sees their own history in detail. The SUMMARY is computed across the whole
// company, because a median price leaks nothing about whose customer it was and the whole value
// of the feature is knowing what the COMPANY charges, not what you personally last charged.
